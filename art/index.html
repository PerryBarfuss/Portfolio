	 One accomplishment for me with art was when I first learned how to draw eyes well. Another was when I was able to draw things
	  like hands. When you think about it though the biggest accomplishment was probably deciding to pick up the pencil in the 
	  first place.
	  
	  One thing that definitely inspired me to be as into art as I am now is definitly cartoons, and animators that I watched on 
	  youtube. Or at least had art as the main part of their channel. I really like cartoons like, Steven Universe, Scooby Doo: 
	  Mystery Incorperated, and Ben 10 which i think really contributed to what my art style looks like today.
